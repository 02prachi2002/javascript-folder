//WINDOW
//->window is a global object
//->this is created by browser
//-> it is repreasented by browser window
//It is a top level entity
// there are three parts of window 
// ->-> DOM
//->-> BOM
//->-> JS Core
//can control anything using browser window

//DOM-Document object model
//it converts the html code to js object 
//BOM-Browser object Model
//content ko chod ke page ke agar javascript kisi browswer se connect karna chahti hai toh BOM usmai help karta hai


//Dom - is tree like model
//having parent 
//to find the element in the html document there are three ways:
//1>getElementbyId()
//2>getElementbyClassName()
//3>getElementbyTagNaame()
//things to keep in mind:
//1) both methods use document object
//2) both return multiple items
//3) the list returned is not am Array
//QUERY SELECCTOR ->it selects the class, id , tag name and prints its first object or single object.
//let a = querySelector(".classname")
//for multiple selection
//use queryselectorall
//inner html
//outer html
//.text contex
//.inner text
//create element
